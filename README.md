# Custom React-like Library

A minimal, custom-built React-like library that re-implements three core Hooks: **useState**, **useEffect**, and **useMemo**. This is intended for educational purposes to illustrate how Hooks can be implemented under the hood.

---

## Overview

This library offers a basic environment similar to React, focusing on three main hooks:

- **useState**: Allows state management within functional components.
- **useEffect**: Enables side effects such as asynchronous data fetching or DOM manipulation.
- **useMemo**: Facilitates memoization of expensive calculations to optimize performance.

> **Note**: This is not production-ready and is only meant for learning and experimentation.

## Features

- **Simple API** mirroring parts of Reactâ€™s design.
- **Lightweight** and easy to understand with minimal internal logic.
- **Illustrative** code that helps demonstrate how hooks might be built from scratch.
